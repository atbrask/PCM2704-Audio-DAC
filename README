PCM2704 Audio DAC v1.0

Based on the circuit discussed at:
http://www.head-fi.org/forum/thread/154844/pcm2704-usb-dac
I have chosen to use the same ICs as this guy, but my schematic is slightly different.

The main reasons for me doing this have been to learn a few things:
1) How to design a circuit. (Even though it's mostly a copy of the examples in the datasheets...)
2) How to use KiCAD.
3) How to get a prototype PCB produced.
4) How to solder SMD stuff.
Now you have the opportunity to learn these things too by using (and perhaps extending) this project.

Although simpler designs using the same chip exist, this is still a pretty straightforward implementation of a USB audio DAC using the quite popular Burr-Brown PCM2704 chip from TI. To drive the headphones, it has a nice little 80mW amplifier chip from Maxim, the MAX4410. This amplifier is powered by its own separate 3.3v power supply based on an LT1763 from Linear Technology. All component values are (more or less) based on the available data sheets for these three chips.

I am quite happy with the result, and my first board worked immediately without any trouble. The gain on the amplifier may be a bit too high for most tastes. Fortunately, this is easy to fix. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader. (Hint: The answer is in the MAX4410 datasheet.)

Happy hacking! :D
